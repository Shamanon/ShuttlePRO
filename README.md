ShuttlePRO
==========

User program for interpreting key, shuttle, and jog events from a Contour Design ShuttlePRO v2 and ShuttleXpress S-XPRS...

This branch contains the original version of the C code for interfacing with the Shuttles. It is based on XTest instead of uinput making it a bit boloated and difficult to work with. This branch is DEPRECATED and was created for historical/reference purposes.
